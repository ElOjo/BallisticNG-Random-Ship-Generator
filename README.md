# BallisticNG-Random-Ship-Generator

Generates random ships in .obj format in the Wipeout 1 form factor.

Major immediate to-dos:

-Fix auto uv mapping;

-Add dual hulls;


Right now the software runs as a standalone program, but the idea is to make it a static or dynamic/shared library.
Currently only builds for Linux as the Windows build suffers from crashes.
